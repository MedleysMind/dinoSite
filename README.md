This is the website for everything related to the in production dino game (title pending).

The goal of this website is to keep all team resources in a single location for easy access.

This way as the team scales up, specific members will be able to access whatever it is that they need.

For example, an artist having access to current sprites and tilesets for reworking, the composer will have a place to access all current music
and any additional programmers can easily find the repo and all docs related to the game.
